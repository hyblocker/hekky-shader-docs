a result unity 2019 4 31f1 has a maximum global shader keyword limit of 384 keywords when you exceed the global keyword limit other shaders will start to break local keywords allow us to make use of keywords without affecting the global keyword limit which means other shaders won't break hekky pbr makes use of local shader keywords as a result of this but the vrchat avatar sdk has a bug which prompts you to remove local shader keywords please do not do this as your materials will break if you would like to see this bug get resolved go upvote this canny ltcgi linearly transformed cosine

Textures","path":"en/shaders/understanding-pbr/creating-pbr-textures","plaintext":"creating pbr textures creating pbr textures is a complex subject and this guide cannot explain everything this page will only give a surface level basic understanding of authoring textures using a pbr workflow using existing pbr materials creating your own pbr materials from scratch is difficult time consuming and expensive thus there are a wide variety of freely available pbr textures you can use ambient cg formerly cc0 textures cgbookcase com share textures 3d textures by icons8 requires attribution i e say that you got the textures from icons8 if using the free license paid license doesn't demand attribution sometimes you'll find pbr textures offered in a sbsar file format you can open these files in substance player and further tweak them to generate unique pbr textures this route is preferred whenever possible over using random pbr textures as due to these textures being freely available users might feel that they are repetitive creating pbr textures from scratch there are numerous methods and tools which can be used to create pbr textures pbr textures are best created using either photogrammetry or tools designed with pbr texturing in mind tools you can use substance suite blender which texture maps should you use good pbr materials generally make use of a couple of texture maps base colour diffuse albedo normal map metallic map roughness map ambient occlusion map a material that doesn't make use of one or more of the above texture maps isn't a bad material"},{"title":"What is PBR?","path":"en/shaders/understanding-pbr/what-is-pbr","plaintext":"what is pbr this explanation is not a technical one it is designed to familiarise you with the core concepts of pbr as understanding them well is important if you want to make or use good textures this explanation will focus the concepts implemented inside of hekky pbr but these should be exchangeable for other shaders too physically based rendering pbr refers to the practise of using realistic i e based on real life physics shading and lighting algorithms to achieve the most photorealistic result possible in 3d rendering while pbr is designed to mimic realistic shading and lighting it does not mean that it can't be stylized pbr is not standardised each application shader and renderer have their own implementation of it luckily the implementations are similar enough to be able to transfer pbr textures from one shader to another core concepts reflections in the real world light rays get reflected off a surface and bounce around the scene the way light gets reflected can be represented in one of two ways based on how rough a surface is specular reflections refer to light rays which are reflected in the exact same angle they arrived in this is basically a mirror and what you normally think of as a reflection specular reflection example demonstrating a highly reflective surface diffuse reflections refer to light rays which are reflected randomly diffuse reflections aren't really reflected in reality the light is absorbed i e the light goes inside the material by the material then scattered about some of the light gets absorbed by the material itself meaning that the light color can changed based on the material this is why we perceive orange painted plastic as orange instead of white for example specular reflection example demonstrating a red and rough surface we can control if a surface uses specular reflections or diffuse reflections with the metal mask parameter a surface cannot be half metallic and half dielectric a dielectric surface is the opposite of a metallic surface you might see metal mask referred to as metalness metallic or metal in other shaders these refer to the same property we can control the reflectivity of a surface via the roughness parameter the rougher a surface is the blurrier the reflections appear the smoother a surface is the smoother the reflections appear smoothness or glossiness is the inverse of roughness energy conservation one of the key principles of pbr rendering in comparision to other rendering methods is the principle of energy conservation this means that a surface never reflects more light than it receives the only exception to this is when a surface is said to be emissive occlusion occlusion refers to the lack of light reaching a surface it's used to tell the shader which parts of the model should be darker than others emission some surfaces such as small leds emit light but are too small to be an entire light source an emissive map is used to allow such surfaces to cast light anisotropy anisotropy refers to stretched specular reflections it's typically seen at angles around a point on a surface too brushed materials are common anisotropic materials anisotropy example"},{"title":"Who Asked","path":"en/shaders/who-asked","plaintext":"who asked who
