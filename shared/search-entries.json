guide cannot explain everything this page will only give a surface level basic understanding of authoring textures using a pbr workflow using existing pbr materials creating your own pbr materials from scratch is difficult time consuming and expensive thus there are a wide variety of freely available pbr textures you can use ambient cg formerly cc0 textures cgbookcase com 3d textures by icons8 requires attribution i e say that you got the textures from icons8 if using the free license paid license doesn't demand attribution sometimes you'll find pbr textures offered in a sbsar file format you can open these files in substance player and further tweak them to generate unique pbr textures this route is preferred whenever possible over using random pbr textures as due to these textures being freely available users might feel that they are repetitive"},{"title":"What is PBR?","path":"en/shaders/understanding-pbr/what-is-pbr","plaintext":"what is pbr this explanation is not a technical one it is designed to familiarise you with the core concepts of pbr as understanding them well is important if you want to make or use good textures this explanation will focus the concepts implemented inside of hekky pbr but these should be exchangeable for other shaders too physically based rendering pbr refers to the practise of using realistic i e based on real life physics shading and lighting algorithms to achieve the most photorealistic result possible in 3d rendering while pbr is designed to mimic realistic shading and lighting it does not mean that it can't be stylized pbr is not standardised each application shader and renderer have their own implementation of it luckily the implementations are similar enough to be able to transfer pbr textures from one shader to another core concepts reflections in the real world light rays get reflected off a surface and bounce around the scene the way light gets reflected can be represented in one of two ways based on how rough a surface is specular reflections refer to light rays which are reflected in the exact same angle they arrived in this is basically a mirror and what you normally think of as a reflection todo specular reflection diagram metal 1 rough 0 diffuse reflections refer to light rays which are reflected randomly todo diffuse reflection diagram metal 0 rough 1 albedo red diffuse reflections aren't really reflected in reality the light is absorbed by the material then scattered about we can control if a surface uses specular reflections or diffuse reflections with the metal mask parameter a surface cannot be half metallic and half dielectric dielectric is the opposite of metal you might see metal mask referred to as metalness metallic or metal in other shaders these refer to the same property we can control the reflectivity of a surface via the roughness parameter the rougher a surface is the blurrier the reflections appear the smoother a surface is the smoother the reflections appear smoothness or glossiness is the inverse of roughness todo roughness diagram metal 1 rough user controlled occlusion occlusion refers to the lack of light reaching a surface it's used to tell the shader which parts of the model should be darker than others emission some surfaces such as small leds emit light but are too small to be an entire light source an emissive map is used to allow such surfaces to cast light light scattering certain surfaces scatter light this means that the light goes through them this can be seen in subsurface scattering and sheen subsurface scattering refers to when light goes through a solid surface and spreads around it before coming out from the other side you might have noticed it when you put your hand in front of a light and your hand glowed an orange red colour this behavior is called subsurface scattering and can be seen on numerous surfaces such as candles curtains and skin todo real life image of subsurface scattering replace with render when hekky pbr suppports it sheen refers to a special type of light behavior typically exhibited by cloths without sheen cloth will most likely look plastic like this is because in real life at grazing angles cloth generally scatters more light than traditional materials todo sheen image with before after refraction in real life transparent and translucent surfaces refract light this is most prominent on common surfaces like glass plastic and lenses refraction is an expensive graphical effect and can negatively affect your framerate use it only if you really need to using refraction for glass for example will negatively affect your performance todo lens glass anisotropy anisotropy refers to stretched specular reflections it's typically seen at angles around a point on a surface too brushed materials are common anisotropic materials anisotropy example"},{"title":"Who Asked","path":"en/shaders/who-asked","plaintext":"who asked who asked is a simple radar shader with audiolink
