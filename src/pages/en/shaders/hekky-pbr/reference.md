**Rendering Mode** Allows you to change the material from opaque mode to transparency mode.

## Main

This section describes the base layer of a material using Hekky PBR.

- **Texture** The albedo / diffuse / base texture. Can also be tinted.
- **Metal Mask** Controls how "metallic" and reflective the material is. Other shaders may call this property `Metal Map`, `Metallness` or something similar.
- **Roughness Map** Controls how "rough" the material is.
- **Invert Roughness** Inverts the roughness map. Enable this if you want to use smoothness instead of a roughness.
- **Normal Map** Allows you to define surface bumps without increasing the polygon count.

## Lighting

This section describes how you may customise how a material reflects light using Hekky PBR.

- **Lighting Mode** Controls the lighting style of the material. You can choose between `Realistic`, `Toon` and `Unlit`.
- **Baked Specular** Enables specular lighting from baked light sources, such as lightmaps and light probes.

> ### Lighting Mode
> 
> - **Realistic** uses a realistic lighting model, and aims for photorealism.
> - **Toon** toonifies the output of the realistic lighting model to achieve PBR toon shading.
> - **Unlit** uses light probes for shading. Doesn't get affected by any realtime lights.

### Toon

This section describes how you can tweak the lighting to achieve a cartoon-esque look.

- **Math Gradient Start** Controls the start of the math gradient for toon shading. Should always be smaller or equal to `Math Gradient End`.
- **Math Gradient End** Controls the end of the math gradient for toon shading. Should always be larger or equal to `Math Gradient Start`.
- **Min Brightness** Controls the minimum brightness when using toon shading. Should always be smaller or equal to `Max Brightness`.
- **Max Brightness** Controls the maximum brightness when using toon shading. Should always be larger or equal to `Min Brightness`.

### Specular

- **Specular** How much to blend between the true color and the tinted specular color on specular highlights.
- **Specular Tint** Allows you to change the color of specular highlights.
- **Specular Mode** Allows you to toggle between isotropic (normal) and anisotropic specular modes.
- **Baked Specular** Enable specular effects from baked light sources. These are not as accurate as realtime ones.

### Anisotropy

- **Anisotropy Map** A texture map that stores anisotropy. Red is anisotropic intensity. Green is anisotropic angle.
- **Angle Offset** Allows you to offset the angles from 0Â°.

### Outline

This section controls outlines.

- **Enable Outline** Enables outline effects.
- **Outline Width** Controls the thickness of the outline.
- **Outline Colour** Controls the outline's colour.

## Emission

- **Emission** Controls the object's emissiveness.

## Occlusion

- **Ambient Occlusion** Controls how much ambient occlusion to apply to the object. Useful to help improve selfshadowing on non-lightmapped materials.
- **Exposure Occlusion** Controls the effect ambient occlusion has on lightmap ambient occlusion. Doesn't effect per-material ambient occlusion.

## Other Modules

- **Bakery** Enables [Bakery](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/level-design/bakery-gpu-lightmapper-122218) support. Required to use Bakery RNM or Bakery SH lightmapping modes, and must match whatever setting is used in Bakery.
- **LTCGI** Enables [LTCGI](https://github.com/pimaker/ltcgi) support.
- **AudioLink** Enables [AudioLink](https://github.com/llealloo/vrc-udon-audio-link) support.

## Misc

- **Render Queue** Controls when to render this material. See the [Unity Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Material.html) for more information.
- **Enable GPU Instancing** Allows Unity to draw objects using the **same mesh** and **same material** using one draw call, yielding performance.
- **Double Sided Global Illumination** Enables double sided global illumination for this material. See the [Unity Docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Material.html) for more information.
