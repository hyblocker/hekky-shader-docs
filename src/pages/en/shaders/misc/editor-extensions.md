## Post Processing Setup

> Hekky > Setup Post Processing

A quick and easy tool to help you setup Post Processing in your Unity Project and Scene with sane default values.

## Studio Lighting Mode

> Press <kbd>F12</kbd>. You can go to Edit > Shortcuts.. to edit keybinds.

This allows you to mimic the Studio Lighting Mode seen in [Blender](https://blender.org/) inside the Unity Scene View. This is particularly useful for navigating dark scenes such as nightclubs.

Allows you to convert a normal map from OpenGL mode to DirectX mode, and vice-versa.
