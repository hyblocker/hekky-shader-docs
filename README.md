# Hekky Shader Documentation

> You probably meant to go to [https://docs.hyblocker.dev/en/](https://docs.hyblocker.dev/en/)

This repository contains the documentation for Hekky's Shaders.

## Contributing

If you wish to translate the documentation to another language or clarify some text in the docs, please either DM me on Discord (you may find me on the support server, see the documentation for the invite), create an issue or file a PR.

## Tech

The documentation uses an entirely custom template on top of Astro, with a few supporting libraries.

### Motivation

I wrote my own documentations generator as I wasn't satisfied with the current solutions. I wanted a good, lightweight documentation generator that had you focus mostly on writing documentation, which doesn't require Javascript. Javascript is used solely to enhance the experience (for example by adding a search function or a swipe to show sidebar function on mobile devices, or to provide WebGL based diagrams to allow the user to better understand a concept by being able to see how certain properties affect the look of a shader).
